1. What is a literal?
    - A literal is a fixed value directly written in the code (e.g., `10`, `'A'`, `"Hello"`).

2. Can you assign different values to a literal?
    - No, literals are constant values and cannot be reassigned.

3. What are literal types?
    - Types include:
    - Integer (e.g., `5`)
    - Floating-point (e.g., `3.14`)
    - Character (e.g., `'c'`)
    - String (e.g., `"text"`)
    - Boolean (e.g., `true`, `false`)
    - Null (`null`)

4. Why do we need escape sequence literals?
    - To represent special characters in strings (e.g., `\n` for newline, `\"` for double quote).
